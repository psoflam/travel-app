          Looking for that weekend Getaway?, To travel from one place to another
          for different purposes is generally called travelling. People do not
          travel always for the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge
          and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for
          business purposes etc. It has much educative value. It is a part of
          education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without
          travelling.

          Need time away from the kids? There is something uniquely refreshing
          about simply spending time being. Not being a Spouse, Child or Parent.
          Not even a friend or co-worker. Just a woman without an agenda or
          to-do list in hand. In being, I found compassion for myself instead of
          the usual pressure to do more, more, more. I don’t think you need to
          be a 45-year old mother or father of two to understand. The time and
          space to be alone with oneself — with no expectations of
          accomplishment or progress — is something we all need more of. Yet,
          it’s not something our society encourages us to pursue.

          Or Just looking to explore? No matter who you are, or where you are
          going, our travel brands help every type of traveler not only find the
          trip that’s right for them, but get the best value every time. Man is
          a traveler by nature. He does not like to keep static at a place for a
          long time. So, people like to visit new places whenever they find time
          and opportunity. People travel for different purposes. Some travel for
          getting an education and some travel for pleasure. Many people also
          travel for business and employment. Travelling is, indeed, very
          pleasant. It is useful too. By traveling to new places we can know new
          people and learn many new things.
